## What to work on at the camp

It can be good to come with a project, but it can also be more fun to camp up next to a complete stranger and start working on something there an then. Be friendly — You never know, you might be sitting next to a Rails or Ruby committer. Holy moly!

Games are always super fun to work on — Lord somers camp offers a unique experience by having projectors at both ends of the main hall, so if there is some sweet gaming action for everyone to join in on… we'll hook it up.

## Ticket refunds

Can't come? Please write to t@toolmantim.com and tell him. We'll re-allocate your ticket to someone else and issue a refund.
